# 📘 Authentication Website with Python

Welcome to my Python learning repository! 

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

A full-stack web application built with **Flask** that enables users to:

- Sign up and create accounts  
- Log in and manage sessions securely  
- Add and delete personal notes  
- Log out with session termination  
- Interact with a basic note board

This project was developed while following the YouTube tutorial:  
🎓 *Python Website Full Tutorial – Flask, Authentication, Databases and More* by **Tech With Tim**.

## 🙋 Motivation

This app serves as an important step in building my larger personal project called **Studyce** (see related repository).  
To effectively test Studyce’s features, I needed to understand how to build a functioning Python-based web application with authentication and CRUD operations.

## 🧰 Features

- ✅ User registration and login  
- ✅ Password hashing for added security  
- ✅ Secure session handling  
- ✅ Input validation
